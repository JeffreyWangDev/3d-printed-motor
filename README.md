# 3d Printed BLDC motor

## Goal
A 3d printed motor, other than the wiring and bolts, that has enough KV to work as a drone motor


I always saw people make 3d printed drones online, but not many fully 3d printed ones, ones with 3d printed motors. I wanted to build one.

## Challenges
1. Tolerances 
2. Winding the motor, people say it takes hours to do
