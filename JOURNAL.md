## Day One
**7 hours**

Today, I looked at designs for BLDC motors and settled on a 16-magnet, 12-winding design. Went over to Onshape and started to design one. I got the outside ring where the magnets sit designed. I also designed the stator base.

For the wiring of the motor coils, I will follow the calculator at [bavaria-direct.co.za](https://www.bavaria-direct.co.za/scheme/calculator/) with 12 slots and 16 poles.

For the wire thickness, I will use 0.5mm for a higher KV motor and also use 0.2mm for a lower KV motor test.
